      "additional_info": "Flume feat. MAY-A - Say Nothing (2022)\nThe music video for \"Say Nothing\" by Flume featuring MAY-A, directed by Michael Hili, offers a visually captivating and surreal experience. It includes psychedelic visuals, with Flume donning a bleach-blonde hairstyle and posing on motorcycles, while MAY-A is seen submerged in black sand. The video uses stark contrasts and vibrant colors to complement the song's themes of post-relationship clarity and emotional expression. This trippy and avant-garde style enhances the song's narrative, making it a standout piece in Flume's discography.\nTechnique - Central Framing , Tableau\nDirector - Michael Hili\nDOP - Dimitri Zaunders, Kieran Fowler\nEditor - Ian Wallace\nColorist - Josh Bohoskey\nOriginal Source - Link\nDAY\nEXTERIOR\nMOTORCYCLE\nBIKER",

      "additional_info": "Tiny Cyberpunk 2077 by Flurdeh (2021)\nFlurdeh specializes in applying a \"tilt-shift\" effect to video games, transforming their expansive 3D environments into charming miniature dioramas. The videos share common features such as accelerated animations and a lower framerate, enhancing their resemblance to stop-motion animation rather than modern video game footage. An example highlighted is Cyberpunk, where the game's diverse settings are miniaturized, and characters are depicted as if they were tiny figurines engaging in everyday activities.\nTechnique - Dystopian , High Angle , Tilt Shift , Video Game\nEditor - Kevin Hensen\nOriginal Source - Link\nNIGHT\nEXTERIOR\nNEON\nSIGN",

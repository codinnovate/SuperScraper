It contrasts iconic landmarks with the grittier areas of Brixton, symbolizing the song's themes. The track itself, produced by London on da Track, samples \"Serenata do Adeus\" and incorporates elements from \"The Shining,\" including the famous line \"Here's Johnny!\" Despite some opinions that the video could have more directly referenced \"The Shining's\" iconic scenes, it has been well-received for its artistic representation and Savage's performance.",

It contrasts iconic landmarks with the grittier areas of Brixton, symbolizing the song's themes. The track itself, produced by London on da Track, samples \"Serenata do Adeus\" and incorporates elements from \"The Shining,\" including the famous line \"Here's Johnny!\" Despite some opinions that the video could have more directly referenced \"The Shining's\" iconic scenes, it has been well-received for its artistic representation and Savage's performance.\nTechnique - Ground Level , Profile\nDirector - Danny Seth\nDOP - Chewy Lodge, JAWMIDNIGHT, Thomas Marchese\nEditor - Anders Mills, Trim Editing\nColorist - Vlad Barin\nOriginal Source - Link\nTutorial - Link\nMALE\nBLUNT\nCIGARETTE\nSMOKING\nSMOKE\nMARIJUANA",

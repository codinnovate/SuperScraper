      "description": "In the 2024 music video 'Risk It All' directed by Dave Meyers, Usher and H.E.R. deliver an emotionally charged performance, underscored by contemporary dance, on a rotating platform in a dimly lit setting. The video, known for its sophisticated yet steamy ambiance, culminates in a poignant moment with Usher tearfully singing the final note. This collaboration is a standout part of 'The Color Purple' soundtrack, showcasing the artistic depth and vulnerability of both artists.",

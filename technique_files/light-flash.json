The video presents a series of grainy, 3D footage that gives off the impression of being shot with night-vision goggles, offering a surreal viewing experience. It mainly showcases Ken Carson partying and performing his lyrics, creating a montage that aligns with the song's themes. The video's eerie and dark aesthetics were noted for drawing inspiration from the style of 1990s Japanese cinema, culminating in a profound, existential moment where Ken faces a haunting black void, adding depth and narrative to the visual experience.",

MAY-A - Say Nothing (2022)\nThe music video for \"Say Nothing\" by Flume featuring MAY-A, directed by Michael Hili, offers a visually captivating and surreal experience. It includes psychedelic visuals, with Flume donning a bleach-blonde hairstyle and posing on motorcycles, while MAY-A is seen submerged in black sand. The video uses stark contrasts and vibrant colors to complement the song's themes of post-relationship clarity and emotional expression. This trippy and avant-garde style enhances the song's narrative, making it a standout piece in Flume's discography.\nTechnique - Central Framing , Light Flash , Void\nDirector - Michael Hili\nDOP - Dimitri Zaunders, Kieran Fowler\nEditor - Ian Wallace\nColorist - Josh Bohoskey\nOriginal Source - Link\nBIRD\nAI\nGENERATIVE\nSTABLE DIFFUSION",

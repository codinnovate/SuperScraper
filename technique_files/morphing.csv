MAY-A - Say Nothing (2022)","The music video for ""Say Nothing"" by Flume featuring MAY-A, directed by Michael Hili, offers a visually captivating and surreal experience.

The video uses stark contrasts and vibrant colors to complement the song's themes of post-relationship clarity and emotional expression.

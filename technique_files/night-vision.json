      "description": "The music video for \"Fighting My Demons\" by Ken Carson, directed by Cole Bennett, was released in 2023 and features unique, glitchy visuals. The video presents a series of grainy, 3D footage that gives off the impression of being shot with night-vision goggles, offering a surreal viewing experience. It mainly showcases Ken Carson partying and performing his lyrics, creating a montage that aligns with the song's themes. The video's eerie and dark aesthetics were noted for drawing inspiration from the style of 1990s Japanese cinema, culminating in a profound, existential moment where Ken faces a haunting black void, adding depth and narrative to the visual experience.",

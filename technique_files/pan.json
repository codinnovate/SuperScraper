The track itself, produced by London on da Track, samples \"Serenata do Adeus\" and incorporates elements from \"The Shining,\" including the famous line \"Here's Johnny!\" Despite some opinions that the video could have more directly referenced \"The Shining's\" iconic scenes, it has been well-received for its artistic representation and Savage's performance.",

This creative decision casts the group members and various elements within the video, such as strippers and guns, in a ghostly, skeletal form, aligning with the group's name and adding a macabre twist to typical rap video imagery. The video was directed by Arnaud Bresson, who, alongside a post-production team, developed a technical device to achieve this X-ray effect without endangering anyone, as no technology exists that can safely film living beings in this way. The process involved multi-camera tracking to record the positions and movements of characters, which were then applied to 3D compositions. This painstaking effort took four months to perfect, but the result effectively complements the song's menacing vibe and the group's exploration of nihilistic themes.","Maxime Caro","Téva Vasseur","Arthur Paux","WOMAN | COUPLE | SEX","Live action pixelation | X-Ray"

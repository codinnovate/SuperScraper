It includes psychedelic visuals, with Flume donning a bleach-blonde hairstyle and posing on motorcycles, while MAY-A is seen submerged in black sand. The video uses stark contrasts and vibrant colors to complement the song's themes of post-relationship clarity and emotional expression. This trippy and avant-garde style enhances the song's narrative, making it a standout piece in Flume's discography.",

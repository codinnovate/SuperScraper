The video was directed by Arnaud Bresson, who, alongside a post-production team, developed a technical device to achieve this X-ray effect without endangering anyone, as no technology exists that can safely film living beings in this way. The process involved multi-camera tracking to record the positions and movements of characters, which were then applied to 3D compositions.

In the video, both artists perform in various gritty, urban settings, enhancing the tough and assertive lyrics of the track. The video features scenes with luxury cars, dynamic group performances, and visually engaging effects that emphasize the rhythm and mood of the music. The overall aesthetic is dark and stylish, with a focus on street fashion and a portrayal of a lavish lifestyle, which is common in hip hop videos. The video complements the song's themes of success, power, and street credibility.",
